For the GSP, the CBWRM was used to develop water budget estimates for the hydrologic period of 1998 through 2017. As discussed in the GSP, the model was developed based on the best available data and information as of June 2018. An assessment of model uncertainty included in the GSP estimated an error range in overall model results of about +/- 10%.

Salinas River Diversion Facility (SRDF) Salinas River diversions and recycled water use numbers from from the Salinas Valley Reclamation Project (SVRP) were received from Monterey One Water. Addtional surface water diversions were downloaded from the SWRCB via eWRIMS and were filtered by location for the 180/400 Foot Aquifer Subbasin. Many growers and residents noted that some irrigation is reported both to SWRCB as surface water diversions and to MCWRA as groundwater pumping. To avoid double counting, all surface water reported as a Statement of Diversion and Use are excluded from the total surface water use. In other words, the total surface water use includes the SRDF river diversions, which were 0 AF/yr. in WY 2022, and appropriative surface water diversions reported to eWRIMS. In WY 2022, approximately 7,600 AF/yr. of the surface water diversions reported to eWRIMS were were reported as a Statement of Diversion and Use and approximately 300 AF/yr. were reported as Appropriative.
